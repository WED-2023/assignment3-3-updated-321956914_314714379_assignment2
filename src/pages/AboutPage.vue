    <h1>About Or & Rudy Recipes</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Or & Rudy Recipes is a full-stack recipe-sharing web application built with Vue.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend.
      Users can search, create, and manage their favorite and recently viewed recipes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The app was developed as a final project for the Web Development course. It demonstrates a complete system with user registration, login, personal recipe management, and integration with both internal and external recipe APIs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">About the Developers</h2>
